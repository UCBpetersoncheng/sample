     *  [Java note: An enum is a class that automatically defines its set
     *  of instantiations, giving each of these objects a name. PERSON,
     *  OCCUPATION, and COLOR are all constant (final) and static.  They
     *  can be compared with each other with == and compareTo, used as the
     *  and cases in 'switch' statements, and converted to the integer
     *  values 0, 1, and 2, respectively, by the method .ordinal().
     *  Thus, the ordinal method allows their use as array indices.
     *
     *  To use the enumeration constants without having to qualify them with
     *  'Entity', use
